This is my summer year training project on "Linux Security and Development of Security Tools using Python."
In this Project I have tried to integrate the knowledge which i have gained during my summer training at LINUX WORLD, JAIPUR.

The main modules that i had to study and research upon are mentioned below :
1. Basic Linux (upto RHCE Level)
2. Python Core
3. Ethical Hacking Core
4. Security in Linux and Web Applications

I would like to thank my trainers Mr. Vimal Daga and Mr. Ashutoshh for their help and guidance in every phase of this project.
I would also like to thank my mentor Mr. Rahul for his help in each and every step of this project.
