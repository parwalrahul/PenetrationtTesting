The Size of 1MB is NOT 1024 KB but only 1000 KB.
In actuality, the whole memory given in our system is in 
KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB.
So Mathematically,
1 MB = 1000 KB
1 MiB = 1024 KiB where MiB stands for MebiByte.
To understand this,
Note that computers work in power of 2
So 1MiB = 2^10 = 1024 KiB
& as we humans prefer working in power of 10
So 1MB  = 10^3 = 1000 KB

Data inside computer is also copied in the KiB, MiB & GiB.
Now you can figure out why a 8 GB pendrive comes only with 7.88 GiB.
