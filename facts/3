The maximum number of partitions supported by any Hard drive are 4

Now You may wonder that you have seen more that 4 Partitions
in many system. How was that possible?
The explanation to that is that there are only 4 primary partitions possible
on any hard drive.
If you want to create more partitions then you have to make one partition as a 
Extended Partition & inside that Extended Partition we can create upto 60 Logical Partitions.

So you can split your hard drive in 4 partitions as 3 Primary Partition and 1 Extended Partition.
& create upto 63 Physical Partitions in a single Hard drive. 

The above rule also applies to our Pendrive.
