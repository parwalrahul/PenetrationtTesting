Have you ever wondered that why you need to reboot your system after
uninstalling any software for the effects to take place ?

The Reason is the RAM of your System.
Basically the Ram is a read only device.
Data can be loaded on it but can't be written on it.
On Reboot,
RAM is recreated.

& this is the reason why We have to reboot our system for effects to take place.
