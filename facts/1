In Linux, You can use the system from 7 different user accounts at a time.

As Linux is a combination of CLI as well as GUI So,
5 Users can log into the CLI (Command Line Interface) &
2 Users can log into the GUI (Guided User Interface).

You can use CTRL + ALT + {F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7} to switch
between these accounts.
