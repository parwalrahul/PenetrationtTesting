			for(i=0;i<10;i++)

Most of the people having a programming background are familiar with this for loop.
And a common myth among most of the people is that :
The First Block (i=0) of the foor loop is the Initialization Block.
& The Last Block (i++) of the foor loop is the Updation Block.

Well, this is absolutely wrong and absurd.
The truth is that :
The first block is simply a statement block and not an initialization block.
So any statement of the progamming language can come inside this block.
Ex: printf("hi") is also a valid statement for the first block.
and for loop does not cares if the condition is true or not, it will simply print hi.

For loop is a unique feature in programming which provides this facility and
only this feature distinguishes it from the while loop.

Now coming to the last block, the last block is not an updation block but a Termination Block
So any valid programming statement come here.
The termination block can be used to execute any statement after validation of condition.
