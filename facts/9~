Do you know that there is no rule for an IP Address (V4) to be of 4 octets
& each octet of 8 bits only.
Let us Understand this with a example :
192.168.0.20 - Valid IP
but even :
192.168.1 is also a valid IP
and even
192 is also a valid IP

There is only one rule for IP and that is it should be able to fit within 4 Bytes
of storage space.
So, any number that can fit in 4 bytes of storage is a valid IP.
Whenever we send the request from our browser or terminal to any IP (in dot notation)
our computer removes the dots and sends the packet to the destination.
Also our IP is stored in decimal in the computer.
so either we type 192.168.0.20 or  3232235540 (decimal form of the ip 192.168.0.20)
It is the same thing..!!
